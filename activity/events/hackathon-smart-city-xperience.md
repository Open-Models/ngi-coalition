## Proposal for the « Smart City Xperience » Hackathon [2023]

The 24-25 November, [Open Geneva](https://opengeneva.org/) sets up a [24-hour hackathon on « smart cities »](https://scx23.sparkboard.com/)
hosted by a higher education establishment ([HEG](https://www.hesge.ch/heg/en)). This is the global
description of the challenge for the event to work on open models
education and the [brick of knowledge](https://open-models.org).

**Submitted challenge (in french):** https://scx23.sparkboard.com/project/65310feeb7f4cd7e6326f537

A way of exploring the relationship between knowledge and society in this work around open models, a way of exploring the use of hackathon
in education (on open models).

### What kind of knowledge transmission to enlighten society with the digital by and for open models?

**The proposed work area is as follows:** contribute to the structuration of an implementation strategy for training in
open models within organisations.

This work is part of a nascent coalition on open models education with the (pending) [application for the Next Generation Internet](https://github.com/Open-Models/ngi-coalition) (NGI) programme/grant,
where we applied at 3 players ([Digital Research Academy](https://digital-research.academy/) [DRA], Open Knowledge Association [OKA] and
[AbcSxyZ](https://github.com/AbcSxyZ/)) with a core project based on this implementation of open models education inside organisations,
supporting DRA and OKA in a first time.

The aim will be to broaden the perspective on how these implementations should be carried out and on the possible
players interested in it, while at the same time experimenting open models education through hackathon to support participants
get to grips with them (and the hackathon work topic).

A learning dimension, enabling the experimentation of the project itself, and a practical dimension, to apply this knowledge
by working on the implementation of trainings. Two mutually reinforcing dimensions.

This will be some sort of meta-hackathon, a hackathon to also think of hackathons as a way to conduct(/implement) open models education (in organisations).

### Framework for Educational Hackathon (on Open Models)

This event would be an opportunity to explore the use of hackathon as an educational tool, particularly for open models,
and to possibly build a hackathon framework around it to prepare the event.

Following the [Hack the Hackathon](https://hackthackathon.github.io/) [6-10 November], a GitHub repository on educational
hackathon have been created to bring together a community and resources: https://github.com/hackthackathon/educational-hackathon

A place to get a better understanding and mastery of the educational dimension of hackathons, built by and for a community of hackathon practitioners.

In connection with this, it may be possible to build a framework more closely related to open models education.

A framework to be experimented during the Smart City Xperience hackathon, as well as being improved during the event itself. This allows us to reflect on what we are doing during the hackathon.

The aim is to have a framework that can be reused by or proposed to other players: various organisations who gravitate around the event,
higher education establishments such as the host, the hack the hackathon participants, NGI consortium members, etc.

An opportunity to promote education on open models within hackathons, shaping in the same time an implementation strategy for open models training inside organisations.

More broadly, it may be possible to consider the [use of hackathons in the construction of digital commons](https://blog.scikit-learn.org/events/sprints-value/),
transforming hackathons in a tool for (open models) education in support of the commons, powered by universities.
